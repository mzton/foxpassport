          When you confirm a Booking Request from a User, you agree to reserve
          the Space indefinitely and not entertain other requests. User
          cancellations create problems for Venues because as the date draws
          closer to the start of the Booking, the Venue's ability to rebook that
          Space becomes increasingly difficult. At the same time, sometimes
          plans change for the Users and they may need to cancel a confirmed
          Booking.
        </v-card-text>
        <v-card-text class="text-subtitle-1">
          Thus, we have developed the Venue4use cancellation policy so that it
          provides some flexibility for Users while still providing security for
          a Venue Manager who has reserved their space for the User.
        </v-card-text>
        <v-card-text class="text-subtitle-1">
          As long as a cancellation is made at least 48 hours before the Booking
          start time, a User may cancel a Booking within 24 hours of the
          Booking's confirmation without further obligation (which is called
          Venue4use Grace Period). If a Booking is made in this 48-hour
          timeframe, or the cancellation is made more than 24 hours after it has
          been confirmed by you, then the following cancellation and refund
          policy apply to Users. Likewise, the Venue will be entitled to a
          portion of their payout depending on what policy they have selected
          and when the cancellation occurs.

          cancellation policy before completing a Booking Request so you are
          aware of the refunds eligible in the event of a cancellation.
